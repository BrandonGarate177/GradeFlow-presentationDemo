# GradeFlow - presentationDemo

Monorepo scaffold for a presentation grading app (frontend + Go backend).

This repository includes starter code and TODOs for:

- A Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend that embeds Google Slides, records audio, and shows grading results.
- A Go backend that accepts uploaded audio, performs placeholder analysis, calls ElevenLabs TTS to produce a model delivery audio file, and returns JSON results.

See README files in `frontend/` and `backend/` for more details on running each subproject.
